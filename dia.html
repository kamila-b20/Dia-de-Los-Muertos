<h1> Dia De Los Muertos: a story! 
	<p1> Once upon a time there was a little pueblo, or village. This village had very few people and everyone knew each other. It was late October and this village, EL Pueblo de Vida, was getting ready for one of the biggest days of the year. Dia Del Los Muertos! This is a holiday celebrated on October 31 to November 2. People decorate alters with marigolds, food, photos, velas (candles), and other offers in order to guide the spirits of their loved ones back home. People make sugar skulls decorated with many colors. 
	</p> 
	<p2> Rosa, one of the little girls in the village was decorating her family alter to remember her grandmother. She missed her so much and always wanted to remember her. Rosa's mother had even said that if Rosa stayed by the alter all night, she would be a ble to see her grandmother's spirit again. 
	</p>
	<p3> Rosa stayed up by the alter all night, waiting from someone to show up. She could hear all of the other villagers with their families rejoining with their loved ones. Rosa was about to give up when her grandfather hobbled in. Her grandfather was a very old man and had a long cane. He was draped with a cloak and he held a lantern. "Mija, your grandmother is here, look!" he whispered. Rosa looked around and couldn't see anything. "Abuelo, i can't see her" she cried out. Her grandfather came over to her, and lifted her hand to her heart. " Rosa, your grandmother will always be here." he said to her. Rosa took a deep breathe, and could almost feel her grandmothers hand on her back. 
	</p>
	<p4> Rosa turned to look at her grandfather who then fell to the ground in a heap. "Abuelo!" Rosa shrieked and ran over to him. Tears filled her eyes as she watched her grandfather melt away into marigold petals. His voice rang in her ears, "always be here."
	</p>
	<p5> Rosa took a deep breath and took the photo of her grandfatherand placed it on the alter. She went to join her family. "Mija, it is okay. Your grandfather came by here already! We must now celebrate his life, not mourn over his death!" her father said. 
	</p>
	<p6> Rosa and her family joined the other families and shared food and stories and celebrated all of the lives of their loved ones. Now Rosa knew that even though her grandparents wouldn't be alive anymore, they would always be in her heart!
